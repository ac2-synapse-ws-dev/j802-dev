The proponent for the use of the index and the methodology to create the index is the USAFRICOM J54."

					"# Index Overview\n",
					"\n",
					"The IRI is a composite index that is built from 30 indicators across two domains (Social Cohesion and Governance Capacity) developed by the IRI assessmeent team [1]. Each indicator is converted from its raw format to a rescaled score between 0 to 2 summarized by the table below.\n",
					"\n",
					"| Score | Interpretation            |\n",
					"|-------|---------------------------|\n",
					"| 0     | low instability risk      |\n",
					"| 1     | moderate instability risk |\n",
					"| 2     | high instability risk     |\n",
					"\n",
					"Based on this method a country can have a score ranging from 0 - 60 with lower scores representing more stability. To ensure consistency with using this index with across countries when analyzing with regards to domains across time, the scores are nomalized again to a 0 - 1 ratio value. This conversion is simply done by the following formula $$normalized\\_score = \\frac{current\\_score}{max\\_score}$$\n",
					"\n",
					"## Methodology Addition\n",
					"\n",
					"In addition to the coversion of the raw data, we will also produce estimates out to the current year of analysis since a few datasets stop their collection prior to the current year of analysis. In these cases we will employ Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) estimates along with building a sample distribution using Metalogs [2] [3].\n",
